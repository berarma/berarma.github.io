These are some works that I can publicly release. Since these are mostly done
in my free time there's no as much updates as I would like.

  * [Redsýs TPV plugin for CakePHP](https://github.com/berarma/cakephp-redsys)

    Take payments with the Redsýs TPV in your CakePHP project with this plugin.

  * [jQuery Free The Cookies](https://github.com/berarma/jquery-freeTheCookies)

    A simple jQuery plugin to handle user consent for website cookies.

  * [Webapp Client Library for Android](https://github.com/berarma/android-webapp/)

    A library to help create custom Webapps without worrying about
    implementation details. Make your site into a Webapp in no time.

  * [Aquarium-toolbox](https://github.com/berarma/aquarium-toolbox)

    Based on the work of the late Carlo Flores, this is a library that can do
    several types of calculations useful for aquarium maintenance.
