Some countries require webs to show a warning about the use of cookies and ask
user permission before using them. This little jQuery plugin shows a banner and
allows setting callbacks that set cookies when the user gives explicit or
implicit permission. It only requires jQuery 1.2+, can be fully customized and
handles user interaction without pain.

That's what I'm using in my web sites and I think it can be useful for anyone
as an easily pluggable solution.
