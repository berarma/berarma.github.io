title: Updated Redsýs plugin for CakePHP
---

Redsýs is the the most used POST service in Spain, allowing card payments for
most Spanish banks. It also operates the cash machine networks for Servired and
4B.

With this plugin you can easily receive payments from this platform on your
CakePHP website.

Currently, it only supports authorizations requests, the most common form of
payment, but it could be easily extended to other transactions. Contributions
welcomed.

I've released new versions of this plugin for CakePHP 2 and 3 improving PHP7
compatibility and making it easier to use than the previous cakephp-sermepa
plugin.
