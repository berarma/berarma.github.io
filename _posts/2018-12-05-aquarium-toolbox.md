This project started as a way to preserve the work of the late Carlo Flores.
His project
[yet-another-nutrient-calculator](https://github.com/flores/yet-another-nutrient-calculator)
allowed calculating the effects of adding different compounds to the aquarium
water.

I've reimplemented his calculations in a easy-to-use API with unit tests. I'd
like to continue his work but right now I don't have the time. This is here
though as a starting point for anyone interested or myself in the future.

In case you're interested on working on this please contact me. I'd like to help.
