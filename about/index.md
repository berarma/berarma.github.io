My name is Bernat Arlandis and I live in Valencia (Spain). I'm a Computer
Engineer and Web Developer very enthusiastic about computers and open source.

I'm currently working as the main web developer at
[Roomsday](http://roomsday.com), an online hotel booking company, and as
freelance I've developed mobile apps for Android, PhoneGap, and also responsive
and SEO-friendly web sites and applications. Although not my main work, I
usually do system administration tasks on GNU/Linux systems since I base all my
work on them and it's sometimes part of my duty.
